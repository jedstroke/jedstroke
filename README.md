# Jedidiah Gabriel 🧔🏽 

[Everything I Do Is For Joan](https://joan.onrender.com)

I am an innovative and hardworking young man who hopes to live for a cause bigger than life, with a scientific approach to solving problems in the most optimal way, and guiding every pixel aesthetically & never letting them go astray. I guilt-trip on every bug that goes unnoticed/noticed. I am not the best out there, but I do my very best in different hats. I am Jedidiah Gabriel, a lifelong learner, and a software engineer.
